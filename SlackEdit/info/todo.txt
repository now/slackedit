SlackEdit Todo File

=============== FILE HEADER ===============

The syntax used in this file goes something like:

	<change_type> <change_description>

where <change_type> is one of:

(Note: The word 'Feature' has quite a loose meaning here)

+ - Feature to add
- - Feature to remove
= - Feature to change
% - Feature to fix
* - Major event
# - Feature to look into
?X - Feature to perhaps X (add/remove/change)

and <change_description> is a short or long
description of what has been done.

============= END FILE HEADER =============

+ Project Manager (same window as clipbook (as msdev)) (in the making)
+ Internal Project Backup

+ Column Mode Editing
+ Configurable Menus
?+ More Tooltips
+ More Command Line Options
+ ISpell Spelling Checker Plugin
+ File Comparison
+ Find/Replace in Files

+ Font specifier in ECP files
+ Auto removal of auto indentation if line empty (as MSDEV does)
+ HexView (debug and file)
?+ Tools
+ Treeview for clipbook
+ Help system
+ add support for --suffix? and --spanquote (for multi line quotes a la not C but easy to implement as hell)
+ ctags support
+ true gnu regexps?
+ get text from menu if not in resource on WM_MENUSELECT?
+ Drag 'n' Drop
+ Monitor the clip files and the tcl files for changes
% Even Faster Loadtime =)
% Make more code generic
% Selection margin cursor won't stick...
* Linux Port
* Source comments
- Useless code =P
+ window tcl command and stuff (file type and file name)
+ on tcl events, i.e. on clipboardchange, on edit, on save...
+ Click on statusbar items to toggle modes and stuff
+ Resize bands when resizing toolbar
+ Fix menu colors
?+ IE Browser support
+ Context menu for mdiclient
+ better regexp searches
* Make Object Oriented (C++)
?- Paste Recent? (could be done with tcl quite easily
+ Tcl Array with SlackEdit settings
+ Ctrl+Up/Down should move items in list[view]s
+ Icons for systabctrls
+ Icons for windowbar, could be filetype (get from shell)
?- Run Dos/Winslows Command (could be done with tcl quite easily)
?% Should there only be one Tcl command line?
+ Split Windows
?% Font selection in Options, or should it perhaps be language specific
?+ A custom message to retrieve the LPEDITVIEW struct
+ Dockable Windows. Will this require C++? Might be possible without. Try to find examples
+ Options dialog control (a la winamp, but much more generic)
% Use the Linked List code for regexps
+ Menu_SetIconHandle()
# Tcl_PkgPresentEx()
+ improve Mem_ funcs for debugging purposes
?% Remove Generic_ from MDI_Child functions
+ mdi_child_modified()
+ mdi_child_create()
+ Remote Edit function (requested by belial_)
+ 'Editable List'. A control that lets the user edit entries in a listbox. Like MSDEV has. A Toolbar for New, Delete, Move Up, Move Down, and when WM_LBUTTONDOWN over an item start a timer and check for mouseclick within that time then popup an edit window over it.
% Fix all goddam EditView_ and TextView_ function names
% Fix the interface of the EditView (for tcl command especially)
?- Remove GotoLine rebar item. it's easy to just type slack::goto_line XXX in tcl command line
?- Remove QuickSearch rebar item. it will be easy to just type slack::search XXX in tcl command line
+ slack::search tcl command
+ slack::goto_line tcl command
+ figure out a way to get the --disablechar/--enablechar to work with tcls { }. (Since they're also used to group stuff (if, for, and so on))
% might want to move slack::clipboard monitor when we have events (i.e. on clipboardchange)
+ Configurable fonts everywhere
+ a plugin interface would be awesome...so that one could be without dialogs or config and such.
% Asking to reload an open file should only be done if the file has been modified.
+ add a tcl debugger
+ create a com like interface for everything
= rename file_interface.h functions
= dockwindow menu needs fixing (check active docking)
= clipbook cliplist combobox needs to be made taller
= clipbook access trough tcl instead
- remove append/prepend clipboard menu items
+ add tcl settings array
% ::slack:: should become ::sled::
% fix exception handling
% fix default button in find dialog
+ find <-> replace mode-toggler
% need to check syntax type for docs at startup after tcl loading is complete
