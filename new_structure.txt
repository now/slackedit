This file contains notes on the further development of pcp_ stuff.
notably SlackEdit (sled)

The file is a list of tasks that need to be done and in the order given
in this file. The items should allow other items and so on to be portable
in that they themselves are portable. Each larger task is split into various
minor parts that may themselves be split in smaller tasks. Function names may
be given in certain cases to explain what functions are required and give a
suggested name to them.

0. Basic Structure

  Specs:
    * Portable
	* Easy to use
	* Expandable
	* Interfaced
	* Light -> Fast
	* Independency
	* Abstract

  Discussion:
	A COM like interface should be provided to each set of functions.
	This will enable making Linux and Windows specific code easier to
	make transparent by providing the same interface. Perhaps this is
	not necessary but looks good and acts good. This should of course
	be discussed with others first to get a good understanding on how
	this is best and easiest implemented.
		Another important part is that it should allow more and more
	complex functions to be built from the basic ones. This is key.
	This means that the base module should only contain code that
	makes life easier for other modules (currently pcp_generic.dll).
	Then a sort of windowing interface (potentially pcp_windowing.dll)
	will be required. From this most other modules can be written
	utilizing only functions in these two modules and from others
	derived from these two.

1. Memory Structure

  Specs:
	* Needs to be portable - Windows/Linux - base in malloc and partners.
	* Should allow for debugging - can be done by using a linked list of
	  alloced blocks and can thus easily be checked if the list is empty
	  upon termination.

  Functions:
	Mem_Alloc, Mem_ReAlloc, Mem_Free, Mem_Verify, Mem_Debug?, Mem_New,
	Mem_Delete

2. File Access

  Specs:
    * Needs to be portable - Windows/Linux - base in file and partners.
	* Should allow for all standard operations and conversions between
	  different files systems (converting / to \\ and so on).

  Functions:
	File_Open, File_Close, File_Read, File_Write, File_GetSize, File_GetLine,
	File_PutLine
