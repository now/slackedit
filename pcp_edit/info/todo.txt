pcp_edit Todo File

=============== FILE HEADER ===============

The syntax used in this file goes something like:

	<change_type> <change_description>

where <change_type> is one of:

(Note: The word 'Feature' has quite a loose meaning here)

+ - Feature to add
- - Feature to remove
= - Feature to change
% - Feature to fix
* - Major event
# - Feature to look into
?X - Feature to perhaps X (add/remove/change)

and <change_description> is a short or long
description of what has been done.

============= END FILE HEADER =============

* Need to rewrite most of the code to support many views of the same buffer.
  I.e. Edit_Buffer_ should be accessible to both the TextEdit and the HexEdit.
  This makes for a lot less code and a much smoother interface and such like.
  Parts of the current PCP_Edit_Interface part may be allowed to be removed if
  this can be done. Virtual Memory Management of open files can be dealt with
  in one consistent way and everything becomes quite a lot more obvious.
  Basically, one representation, many views; i.e. DOC/VIEW structure to it.
