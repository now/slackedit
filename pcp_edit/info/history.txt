pcp_edit History File

=============== FILE HEADER ===============

The syntax used in this file goes something like:

	<change_type> (<date>): <change_description>

where <change_type> is one of:

(Note: The word 'Feature' has quite a loose meaning here)

+ - Added feature
- - Removed features
= - Changed feature
% - Fixed feature
* - Major event

and <change_description> is a short or long
description of what has been done.

============= END FILE HEADER =============

+ (07/16/00): Stable line wrapping when end of line (pos 2050) reached. (TextBuffer_InsertLine, TextBuffer_AppendLine, and TextBuffer_InternalInsertText needed updating)
% (07/16/00): Fixed a bug that made the last character of the longest line always visible while scrolling to the far right.
+ (07/16/00): Added PEM_GETOVERWRITEMODE and PEM_SETOVERWRITEMODE messages.
% (07/06/00): Now Replacing text with a search is only one undo (was insert/delete).
* (07/06/00): Added History File to project. A little late considering how much has been added and changed in this project so far.
