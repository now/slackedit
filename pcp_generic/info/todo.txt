=============== FILE HEADER ===============

The syntax used in this file goes something like:

	<change_type> <change_description>

where <change_type> is one of:

(Note: The word 'Feature' has quite a loose meaning here)

+ - Feature to add
- - Feature to remove
= - Feature to change
% - Feature to fix
* - Major event
# - Feature to look into
?X - Feature to perhaps X (add/remove/change)

and <change_description> is a short or long
description of what has been done.

============= END FILE HEADER =============
