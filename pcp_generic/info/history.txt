pcp_generic History File

=============== FILE HEADER ===============

The syntax used in this file goes something like:

	<change_type> (<date>): <change_description>

where <change_type> is one of:

(Note: The word 'Feature' has quite a loose meaning here)

+ - Added feature
- - Removed features
= - Changed feature
% - Fixed feature
* - Major event

and <change_description> is a short or long
description of what has been done.

============= END FILE HEADER =============

% (07/19/00): Fixed String_ProcessHotkey. Now much faster and smarter and extensive.
+ (07/06/00): Added hashtable functions. Mostly a rip from glib
+ (07/06/00): Added math functions Math_Clamp (from glib) and Math_ClosestPrime (from glib)
* (07/06/00): Added History File to project. A little late considering how much has been added and changed in this project so far.
